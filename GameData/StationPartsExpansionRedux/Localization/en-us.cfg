     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_default = The plants are as mellow and serene as can be. No, you can't harvest them yet.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_SunInSpaceLow = An associate external climate sensor's needle leans pretty close to the red. For the love of the nearest cook, keep those shutters closed!
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_SunInSpaceHigh = You open a shutter to see what difference its impact on a plant may be, now that you are beyond Kerbin's influence... and its protection... A plant shrivels visibly quickly. You make a note to absolutely never do this again.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_KerbinInSpaceLow = The plants grow very slowly, if at all. It may be far too soon for any note-worthy results to appear.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_KerbinInSpaceHigh = You open a shutter to see what impact it may have on the plants. Nothing happens immediately but later on you log that one of them has shriveled and possibly burned, particularly a sun-ward plant. That's not a good sign.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_KerbinSrfLanded = The plants sparkle. They must be quite happy to be here.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MunInSpaceLow = The taller plants gravitate toward the Mun. Get it? Gravitate?
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MunInSpaceHigh = As you study the plants you ponder the possibility of farming on Mun's surface.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MunSrfLanded = You're tempted to shovel some Mun soil into a pot and sow it. However, a bit of red tape needs to be cut for this dream to take root.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MunSrfLanded = You fetch some Mun soil and apply it to a marked pot. The growth rate seems unchanged, however, it bares fruit a little slower than its partner in pure Kerbin soil.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_Minmus_InSpaceLow = Several leaves seem to change color. They appear to be trying to make some form of connection with Minmus.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_Minmus_InSpaceHigh = The plants gravitate toward Minmus. How is it possible with Minmus' miniscule gravity?
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MinmusSrfLanded = Is Minmus made of ice cream? Will the plants grow in it? You beg for R&D's permission for this test.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MinmusSrfLanded = You fetch some Minmus soil and apply it to a marked pot. It begins to wither... You confirm that this soil is too moist and has both great highs and lows in nutrients.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MohoInSpaceLow = The plants have darkened a bit but they seem as fine as ever.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MohoInSpaceHigh = You spot a large hole in the soil of a sample plant, and the plant itself is gone... What the kraken?
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MohoSrfLanded = It actually worries you, the idea of sampling this soil for the experiment. You hesitate to begin.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_MohoSrfLanded = Given the fairly extreme situation here you prepare two marked pots with Moho soil. One plant withers but the other grows tall and bares no fruit. Later diagnosis reveals that plant Chemistry is very fussy with Moho.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EveInSpaceLow = Gravitating towards Eve now, you wonder whether they changed their minds or if it's finally actual gravioli that's pulling them.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EveInSpaceHigh = The plants gravitate...away from Eve. They must want not to be here.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EveSrfLanded = The plants grow thicker and shorter, and their taller portions wither. Eve's gravity must be overwhelming them.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EveSrfLanded = The sample plant withers as you approach it with the steamy purple soil. This must be some really potent stuff.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EveSrfLanded = You fetch some Eve soil and apply it to two marked pots. You note that one withers, very likely due to poisoning, meanwhile the other, which happens to be an Orchid, grows wildly and wraps around the pot like a kraken's tentacles.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_GillyInSpaceLow = Oh look, a young fruit. You note its presence and make an uneventful diagnosis.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_GillyInSpaceHigh = The plants show no notable new characteristics. Gilly must not register to them.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_GillySrfLanded = You find it particularly hard to fetch the soil sample for the experiment. If only Gilly was a bit more massive.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_GillySrfLanded = You fetch some Gilly soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant shows no response for better or worse so Gilly must be just right.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_IkeInSpaceLow = The plants gravitate toward Ike. The plants like Ike.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_IkeInSpaceHigh = The transit time seemed to be on point. The seasonal plants are flowering.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_IkeSrfLanded = You fetch some Ike soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant grows faster than normal. It looks like Mun has competition.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_IkeSrfLanded = You fetch some Ike soil and apply it to a marked pot. It shows no new behavior, and is confirmed to be just right.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DunaInSpaceLow = The plants are in full bloom. Now is as good a time as any to try to colonize Duna.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DunaInSpaceLow = You wonder what the plants really think about te red planet, given their ability to show interest towards Kerbin's moons.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DunaInSpaceHigh = You note a mild but increasing redness in the fruits and flowers.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DunaSrfLanded = You fetch some Duna soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant shows signs of starvation, maybe even poisoning. You determine that the metal content is too dang high!

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresInSpaceLow = The plants no longer respond. They are mellow and they grow at their normal pace.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresInSpaceHigh = The plants release water droplets and they float about loosely, or slowly fall away back into their soil. Perhaps they are showing more emotion? Are they crying?
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresSrfLanded = You fetch some Dres soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant withers away due to starvation. It's as if the plant did not or could not acknowledge the presence of any soil.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresSrfLanded = You fetch some Dres soil and apply it to a marked pot. They show no new characteristcs, meaning Dres must be good for farming on.

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolInSpaceLow = The plants sparkle again. Something about Jool must really appeal to them.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolInSpaceHigh = The plants gravitate toward Jool. Maybe there's something with green bodies.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolSrfLanded = You take a moment to think very, very hard before letting any of the outside environment into this greenhouse.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolSrfLanded = ...Lol

  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheInSpaceLow = The plants begin blossoming sooner than expected. Laythe must be posing some kind of beneficial effect on them even at this height.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheInSpaceHigh = The plants appear very bright and healthy. It's as though they
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheSrfLanded = You fetch some Laythe soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant withers and you determine that there is too much moisture and there may be another extreme imbalance of nutrients.
  	#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheSrfLanded = You fetch some Laythe soil and apply it to a marked pot. It grows well and even slightly faster and fuller than it did on Kerbin.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_default = You look out the windows at the sights around you.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_SunInSpaceLow = The light is absolutely blinding, and you can only peer out for brief periods of time before turning away from its power.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_SunInSpaceHigh = Space is so barren out here, with nothing to see for millions and millions of kilometers.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_KerbinInSpaceLow = It's just like a painting. You see vibrant greens, blues, and tans pass you by underneath, and have to gasp at its beauty.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_KerbinInSpaceHigh = All of history seems so small and insignificant from out here. All of it enclosed in a pale blue dot.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_KerbinSrfLanded = Yup, it's a window alright. A really expensive one at that.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MunInSpaceLow = Solemn greys pass you by, mountains and valleys that seem utterly desolate and foreign.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun and Kerbin seem to rule the skies as equal partners from this point of view.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MunSrfLanded = You hold up your thumb and blot out Kerbin. You suddenly feel very, very humble.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_Minmus_InSpaceLow = Rolling hills and imposing plateaus give way to sheer cliff faces and flats as far as the eye can see. Those flats appear to be very promising landing sites.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_Minmus_InSpaceHigh = Minmus is still very small in the night sky, with no real noticeable features yet.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MinmusSrfLanded = A minty green as far as the eye can see, subliminally making you crave a certain dessert. You brush aside the thoughts, as no treats were to be found here.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoInSpaceLow = This planet seems burnt to its very core, battered by impacts and baked by billions of years close to Kerbol.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoInSpaceHigh = You gaze out at Moho's dark brown surface, wondering how much you've tanned it the time you were in the window.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoSrfLanded = You have to squint to even make out the rocks around you, and the air is very hot in the window.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EveInSpaceLow = Eve's silver seas and purple soil wait ominously below.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EveInSpaceHigh = Despite its distance, Eve's size and color commands great respect in the night sky.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EveSrfLanded = The toxic purple wind whips against the side of the window, slowly eroding the glass. You feel uncomfortable.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_IkeInSpaceLow = Looks just like the Mun to me.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_IkeInSpaceHigh = Whether you got here by accident or on purpose, Ike isn't much of a looker. You divert your eyes back to Duna instead.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_IkeSrfLanded = Upon closer inspection, Ike's dark grey rocks are pretty interesting to look it. You wish you hadn't judged Ike so harshly.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaInSpaceLow = You can make out the traces of ancient red valleys, riverbeds, and lakes. What happened to them?
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaInSpaceHigh = Duna's bright reds and whites stand out against the sky. It looks more welcoming thean mencacing.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaSrfLanded = While the rusty reds of the soil and sky feel strange and unfamiliar, you could see this as your home in the future.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresInSpaceLow = The planet is mostly boring, but the bright grey portions, deep canyon, and pockmarked craters are interesting to see.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresInSpaceHigh = What? There's a planet here? I don't see it.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresSrfLanded = The topography is more interesting than you thought it would be, but the trip was still too long to be worth it.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's green cloud bands fill up your whole vision, enveloping you in a delicate dance of gases.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_JoolInSpaceHigh = This far away, Jool's interesting system beckons to you. So close, but so far away.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_JoolSrfLanded = How your window hasn't shattered yet you have no idea.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe's shallow seas, secluded islands, and vibrant blue atmosphere beg to be visited and settled.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_LaytheInSpaceHigh = The small island chains speak of an untouched paradise waiting to be explored.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_LaytheSrfLanded = The shoreline vista soothes you, the sound of lapping waves around you. Far above, a green giant reminds you that these are alien skies.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallInSpaceLow = Despite the interesting coloration, Vall doesn't have much to show off. At least, in comparison to Jool itself.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallInSpaceHigh =This blue ball looks markedly different from Laythe. You wonder what it would take to transform that ice into seas.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallSrfLanded = If you were colorblind, you would have no way of distinguishing Vall from Minmus. You know, except for the massive green ball in the sky.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloInSpaceLow = You feel that coming any closer to this moon would mean your end. You shy away from the window.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo rules the sky as much as Jool from this vantage point. You picture them dueling for supremacy of the moons.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloSrfLanded = Tylo's surface is rocky and dull but still somehow intimidating. You feel stranded.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopInSpaceLow = Though Bop itself is unassuming, odd noises in the ship give you the feeling you are unwelcome here.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopInSpaceHigh = The moon is a mere brown speck among the grandeur of Jool's other moons.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopSrfLanded = Though the surface is barren and desolate, you get chills, as if some powerful force was watching you.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolInSpaceLow = Pol's lumpy surface casts deep, long shadows over its many valleys.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolInSpaceHigh = Despite being a mere speck, Pol's unique color gives it an air of mystery and importance in the Jool system.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolSrfLanded = Interesting, craggy shapes stick out of the surface amid the cavernous valleys and towering hills. This is a place that demands to be explored.

     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EelooInSpaceLow = The icy mood of the crew is alleviated by looking at the world below you. You have no desire to land in the yellow snow.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EelooInSpaceHigh = This far out, the isolation grows to new levels. The dimness of Kerbol doesn't help.
     #LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EelooSrfLanded = Despite the distance, this place seems a little like home, - winter on Kerbin.
