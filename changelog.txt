- Fixed flag for lab replacement
- Changed rotation of replacement docking port and extensibledocking port to be consistent with the original part
- Small fix to deployable module resource costs: will now round resources, so you are less likely to get issues where you have 1999.999993 resources when you think you have the 2000 needed to deploy
- Added optional SpinResource and SpinResourceRate to ModuleDeployableCentrifuge - allows specification of a resource and a rate needed to rotate the thing
